# Class TimeTable Manager

## Problem Statement

To simplify the process of managing Online classesâ€™ Invites.

## The problem

Ever since the classes have gone online, teachers are using services like zoom to teach students.
But they face a big problem when sharing those links with students.
Mailing them to students create a lot of confusion with students while managing every single mail.

## The solution

We will create a website where teachers can create different classes and save there invites there instead of mailing to students.
Students can directly access those links.

## How it works ?

Steps:

- Teacher creates classes
- Teacher add Students to their respective classes
- Teacher uploads class links for each class
- Student access them from their respective classes
- Student access classes from their calendar.
